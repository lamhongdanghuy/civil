    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutral (Stone, Teal) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a dashboard with a sidebar for daily topic navigation and a main content area. This replaces the static table with an interactive, topic-focused view, which is better for daily learning. Users can select a day to view its 10 vocabulary words as interactive "flashcards." Clicking a card reveals its details (definition, translation, example), promoting active recall. A search bar provides global dictionary-like functionality. This structure enhances usability by breaking down content and adding interactivity tailored to learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Daily vocabulary lists. Goal: Learn/review terms. Viz/Presentation: Interactive cards in a grid. Interaction: Click-to-reveal details on cards, sidebar navigation to change topics, and a search bar to filter all terms. Justification: This card-based system is more engaging for study than a static table. It allows self-pacing and self-testing. Search adds long-term reference value. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for logic, Tailwind CSS for layout and styling. -->
